An application that showcases the various features of Aurelia UX.

## Machine Setup

This app is built on the Aurelia CLI, which has a couple of prerequisites you must install first. If you have previously setup your machine for the Aurelia CLI, you can skip this step.

* Install NodeJS >= 4.x
    * You can [download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* Install NPM 3.x
    * Even though you may have the latest NodeJS, that doesn't mean you have the latest version of NPM. You can check your version with `npm -v`. If you need to update, run `npm install npm -g`.
* Install a Git Client
    * Here's [a nice GUI client](https://desktop.github.com).
    * Here's [a standard client](https://git-scm.com).

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can install the Aurelia CLI itself. From the command line, use npm to install the CLI globally:

```
npm install aurelia-cli -g
```

> Note: Always run commands from a Bash prompt. Depending on your environment, you may need to use `sudo` when executing npm global installs.

## Application Setup

Once you've setup your machine (or if it's been previously setup), you simply need to install the dependencies. From within the app folder, execute the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Running The App

To run the app, execute the following command from within the app folder:

```
au run --env dev
```

See [the CLI documentation](https://github.com/aurelia/cli) for other available commands or type `au help` on the command line.
